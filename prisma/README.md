## Prisma Migrations

Migrations in Prisma are a way to manage and evolve your database schema over time. They allow you to keep your database schema in sync with your Prisma schema and application code. Here's how migrations work in Prisma:

1. **Define Schema**: You start by defining your database schema using the Prisma Schema Language in your `schema.prisma` file. This includes models that correspond to tables in your database.

2. **Generate Migration**: When you make changes to your `schema.prisma` file (like adding a new model or field, changing a field, or deleting something), you need to migrate your database to reflect these changes. You do this by running the command:

```
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_migration_name
```

This command does two things:

- It generates a new SQL migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory, which contains the necessary SQL commands to update the database schema.
- It applies the migration to update the database schema.

3. **Apply Migration**: The SQL migration files are applied to your database, modifying its schema to match the changes you made in the Prisma schema. This step is automatically handled by the `migrate dev` command during development.

4. **Production Migrations**: For production environments, you use:

```
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

This command applies all pending migrations found in the `prisma/migrations` directory to your production database. It's designed to be safe for production use, ensuring that your database schema matches your Prisma schema.

5. **History and Version Control**: All migrations are saved in your version control system (like git), allowing you to see the history of your schema changes over time. This is useful for collaboration and tracking changes across different environments.

Migrations in Prisma help ensure that your database schema evolves consistently with your application's data model, reducing the risk of discrepancies and errors.
